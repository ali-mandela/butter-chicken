"""Triage gate: determine whether a test failure is a bug or a script issue.

Getting this wrong in one direction ships defects. The bias is deliberately
asymmetric: a real regression masked as a script issue gets fixed by the agent
rather than reported; a false positive costs a repair cycle but not a bug.

The rules are deterministic first (fast, no model), with a single exception:
LOCATOR_NOT_FOUND is genuinely ambiguous and consults the model only in that case.
