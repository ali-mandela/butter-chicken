    Apply credentials to a step value, aware of the flow kind and intended use.

    This is the single place that decides what a credential field receives. Getting the
    rules wrong silently converts every negative test into a duplicate happy-path test,
    so this function is critical to test quality.

    Rules, in order:
    1. If the step verb is not 'fill', return the value unchanged. Never give a credential to a click.
    2. If the step already has a non-empty value, return it unchanged.
    3. Empty-field tests must stay empty. If flow_name (lowercased) contains 'empty', 'blank',
       'missing', 'no username', 'no password', or 'without', return None so the field is
       submitted empty. An intentionally blank field IS the test in this case; filling it
       would destroy the scenario.
    4. If flow_kind is NEGATIVE or ERROR_STATE, take the value from INVALID_CREDENTIALS
       instead of credentials. A negative flow that logs in successfully is not a negative flow.
    5. Otherwise, behave as before: target containing 'pass' → password; containing 'user',
       'email' or 'login' → username; else return the original value.

    This is how secrets reach the test WITHOUT passing through the model.
